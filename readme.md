# Taxi queue app

A local taxi association needs some help to manage queues at some of their taxi ranks.

<span style="float: left">
	<img src="queue.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block" >
	<img src="queue.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block" >
	<img src="queue.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block" >
	<img src="minivan.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block">
	<img src="arrow.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block">
	<img src="minivan.png" alt="" width="100" style="display:inline-block">
</span>

They need a web widget which rank managers can use to keep track of how many people are joining and leaving taxi queues. They also want to keep track of how many taxis are queueing.

## How It works

The widget should keep track off:

* People joining the queue 
	- add 1 to the queue
* People leaving the queue 
	- remove 1 from the queue
* Taxis joining the queue 
	- add 1 to the taxi queue
* Taxis leaving the queue:
	- remove 1 from the taxi queue
	- remove 12 people from the people queue
* A taxi can only leave if there are enough people (12 people) in the queue to fill the taxi.
